Task-2 : Problem Statement: Student Result Processing System 
Design and implement a Student Result Processing System in C

Folder structure
stdResultPrcgSys.c  --- Main entry point
fileOps.c/h         --- Input parsing + output file writing
student.c/h         --- Student structures, Result calculation, grade logic
validation.c/h	    --- student data validation
trie.c/h            --- Duplicate and valid roll number checking
input.txt	    --- Input file containing student details
op.txt 		    --- Student Results file

Notes:

Input file:
The input student records can be single / multiple lines. But it should follow the order
student roll no, name, subj1 name, minor, major, and so on for the remaining 4 subjects.
The input is expected to be complete, i.e. complete student information along with 5 subject information is given.

Validation:
Roll number- Alphanumeric + Unique
Name- Only alphabets
Minor marks- [0,40]
Major marks- [0,60]

Result processing:
For each subject we assigned total = minor + major marks, grade, point. 
Grading is based on this scale
o ≥ 90 → 0 → 10
o 85-90 → A+ → 9
o 75-85 → A → 8
o 65-75 → B+ → 7
o 60-65 → B → 6
o 55-60 → C → 5
o 50-55 → D → 4
o < 50 → F → 0

Each student gpa is calculated as the sum of points by the number of subjects 
and percentage is calculated as the sum of total marks by number of subjects
and based on percentage each student is given overall grade.

The avg, high and low percentage is calculated based on student percentages 
and Number of students in each grade category is based on student overall grade.

Output: 
Output has the following columns
StdRNO	StdName	Sub1	Minor	Major	Total	Grade	Point	Sub2	Minor	Major	Total	Grade	Point	Sub3	Minor	Major	Total	Grade	Point	Sub4	Minor	Major	Total	Grade	Point	Sub5	Minor	Major	Total	Grade	Point	TotalMarks	GPA	Percentage	OverallGrade

Followed by Class Average Percentage, Highest and Lowest Percentage, Number of students in each grade category.

Running the Program

Build the files using make

		make 
   		
The program requires two command-line arguments: the input file (student records) and the desired output file (processed student result records) name.

run it as 

		./stdResultSys input.txt op.txt
	
To clean the files	

		make clean
